                <p style="text-transform:none">The two competing national suffrage organizations before us were the NWSA and AWSA. They lasted over two decades. Suffragists worked to mend the split from the start, but were unsuccessful. Alice Stone Blackwell, the daughter of the American association leader Lucy Stone, spearheaded successful negotiations to merge the two groups in 1890. </p>
                <p style="text-transform:none">After the combination of the two groups, the NWSA and AWSA to create this organization, NAWSA, we quickly got to work. After a decades-long fight we were able to gain significant traction and support by 1920. After World War 1 had ended, the President Wilson saw the amount of support and decided to proceed with passing the amendment.</p> 
                <p style="text-transform:none">After having gained suffrage for women voters we now believe that it is time to change our goals and advance further. Our new goal is to spread the idea of not only voters rights for women, but also push for overall equality</p>

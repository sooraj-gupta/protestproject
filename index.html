                <p style="text-transform:none">The two competing national suffrage organizations before us were the NWSA and AWSA. They lasted over two decades. Suffragists worked to mend the split from the start, but were unsuccessful. Alice Stone Blackwell, the daughter of the American association leader Lucy Stone, spearheaded successful negotiations to merge the two groups in 1890. </p>
                <p style="text-transform:none">After the combination of the two groups, the NWSA and AWSA to create this organization, NAWSA, we quickly got to work. </p> 
                <p style="text-transform:none">Our goal as an organization is to convince not only the men and women around us that it is our obligation to fight for women's suffrage, but we need to also convince those of higher power to create the change that we are pushing for, which is the right for women to vote in this democratic nation</p>

                <p style="text-transform:none"> Men and women are equal. The ideals we stand for in NAWSA aren’t solely to put women on a pedestal higher than men, it is to raise women to the same level that men are at. This would mean equal treatment for both men and women. This starts with the most prominent right that men have but not women. The right to vote. This leads into the overall goals of our organization, NAWSA</p>
